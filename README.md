# Code-Kitten #
===========

Code-Kitten is a macro-level javascript code analyzer to accompany low-level js hinting tools (like jslint).

Try it out for yourself here: http://chaoscollective.org/projects/codekitten

Code-Kitten helps you find high-level patterns that often make code buggy, slow, and hard to manage.

Code-Kitten is fast and frisky. Code-Kitten doesn't like repeated fluff and sluggish bottlenecks. Code-Kitten wants to maxamize treats and playtime. And Code-Kitten wants to do it with you. Fact.

Code-Kitten is great at looking for bits of duplicate code within a file. Using the same code twice upsets Code-Kitten because it may introduce bugs later if only one section of the code is updated. Proof. 11 out of 10 cats agree that modular non-duplicate code is a good thing (and yes, Code-Kitten's vote counts twice).
